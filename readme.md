# LabOS

LabOS is a scratchpad workspace for experiments, prototypes, and lab-style notes. Use this repository to quickly spike ideas, document findings, and keep lightweight utilities in one place.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone** the repo and open it in VS Code.
2. **Create a virtual environment** if you plan to use Python tooling: `python -m venv .venv`.
3. **Activate** the environment and install any experiment-specific dependencies.

## Recommended Workflow

- Keep each experiment or note in its own subfolder so history stays tidy.
- Commit frequently with clear messages capturing the experiment context.
- Clean up intermediate artifacts (datasets, build outputs) or add them to `.gitignore`.

## Folder Ideas

| Folder | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `notes/` | Markdown notes, logs, or checklists. |
| `experiments/` | Self-contained spikes or PoCs. |
| `scripts/` | Utility scripts used across experiments. |

## Contributing

This is your sandbox—organize it in whichever way best supports your lab work. When collaborating, align on naming, coding style, and documentation expectations up front.
