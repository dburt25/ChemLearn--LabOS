# Simulation Engine Vision

Defines the long-term plan for LabOS simulation capabilities.

## Objectives
- Provide reproducible, parameterized simulations for chemistry and physics domains.
- Integrate seamlessly with experiment/job workflows.

## Architecture Concepts
- Modular solvers with shared state representations.
- Deterministic seeding and checkpointing for auditability.

## Roadmap Hooks
- Phase 3: identify priority simulations with SMEs.
- Phase 4: prototype solvers + validation harnesses.
- Phase 5+: production engine with UI + CLI integration.
