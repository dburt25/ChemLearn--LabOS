# Organic Chemistry Design Module (Draft)

Concept for a module that teaches and assists in organic synthesis planning.

## Capabilities
- Reaction suggestion engine with explainable rules.
- Mechanism walkthroughs and assessment tooling for learners.

## Requirements
- Curated reaction database with licensing cleared.
- Safety checks for hazardous pathways.

## Roadmap
- Prototype heuristics in Phase 3.
- Integrate with UI learner mode in Phase 4.
- Add advanced analytics + assessment loops in Phase 5.
