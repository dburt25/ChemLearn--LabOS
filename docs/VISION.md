# ChemLearn LabOS Vision

ChemLearn LabOS is a faith-aligned chemistry learning and discovery platform that unites experiments, jobs, datasets, and scientific instruction within a single auditable operating system.

## Guiding Intent
- Deliver a unified environment that students, researchers, and clinical labs can all trust.
- Build every feature with "truth above profit" as a non-negotiable value.
- Treat regulatory compliance (FDA, ISO 13485/14971, IEC 62304, ALCOA+, HIPAA/GDPR) as design inputs, not afterthoughts.

## Audience & Reach
- **Learners:** high school through post-doctoral students who need safe sandboxes.
- **Researchers:** interdisciplinary scientists who require reproducible experiments.
- **Clinicians & Labs:** future SaMD deployments that demand validation and traceability.

## Long-Horizon Outcomes
1. LabOS Core orchestrates experiments/jobs/datasets with deterministic reproducibility.
2. Scientific modules plug in cleanly, each verified against gold-standard references.
3. UI shells (Learner, Lab, Builder modes) keep every action logged and explainable.
4. Knowledge feeds and simulations continuously expand capabilities while respecting governance.

## Phase Alignment
- **Phase 0:** Bootstrap folders, docs, and governance (current phase).
- **Phase 1:** Implement LabOS Core scaffolding and persistence APIs.
- **Phase 2+:** Layer on data pipelines, scientific packs, UI control surfaces, and ML upgrades.
