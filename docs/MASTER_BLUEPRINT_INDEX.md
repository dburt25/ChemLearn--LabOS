# Master Blueprint Index

This index connects every LabOS macro-plan so future swarm agents can find the right reference quickly.

## Core Strategy Docs
- `VISION.md` — north star intents and beneficiaries.
- `ChemLearn-The-Universal-Chemistry-Learning-and-Discovery-Engine.md` — high-level overview for new collaborators.
- `INVARIANTS.md` — non-negotiable rules the system must obey.
- `PHASES_OVERVIEW.md` — staged roadmap for the entire build.
- `DEVELOPMENT_VISION_GUIDE.md` — execution principles derived from the vision.

## Governance & Swarm Ops
- `SWARM_PLAYBOOK.md`
- `SWARM_PERMISSIONS_MATRIX.md`
- `SWARM_GOVERNANCE.md`
- `SWARM_BOOT_PROCEDURE.md`
- `COMPLIANCE_CHECKLIST.md`

## Architecture & Schemas
- `README_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `DATA_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `EXPERIMENT_SCHEMA.md`
- `JOB_SCHEMA.md`
- `AUDIT_LOG_FORMAT.md`

## Specialized Plans
- Capability and module plans under `docs/*PLAN.md`
- Compliance artifacts (`compliance-notes.md`, `RESEARCH_USE_ONLY.md`, etc.)
- CHANGELOG/VALIDATION_LOG at repo root capture incremental evidence.

## Usage Notes
- Keep this index alphabetized within each section when adding new blueprints.
- Link out to external references in `REFERENCES.md` instead of duplicating content here.
