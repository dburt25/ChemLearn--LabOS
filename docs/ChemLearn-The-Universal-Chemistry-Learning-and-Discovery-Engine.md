# ChemLearn – The Universal Chemistry Learning & Discovery Engine

This overview distills the intent behind ChemLearn LabOS.

## Mission Snapshot
- Deliver an operating system that unites curriculum, experimentation, and research tooling.
- Keep truth, transparency, and compassion at the center of every feature decision.
- Provide the same reproducible pipeline to learners, researchers, and clinicians.

## Architectural Pillars
1. **LabOS Core:** experiment, dataset, job, and audit primitives.
2. **Scientific Modules:** pluggable domain packs (PChem, EI-MS, proteomics, simulation).
3. **Interface Layer:** CLI, REST, and future UI shells (Learner/Lab/Builder modes).

## Compliance & Safety Hooks
- Enforce ALCOA+ data integrity disciplines.
- Treat FDA 21 CFR Part 11, ISO 13485/14971, IEC 62304, HIPAA/GDPR as design constraints.
- Capture decision trails in `compliance-notes.md` and future validation dossiers.

## How to Use This Overview
- Pair it with `VISION.md` for narrative context.
- Reference `DEVELOPMENT_VISION_GUIDE.md` for execution details.
- Consult `PHASES_OVERVIEW.md` to understand sequencing.
