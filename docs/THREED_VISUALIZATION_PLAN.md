# 3D Visualization Plan (Draft)

Plan for immersive visualization of molecular structures and simulations.

## Goals
- Provide intuitive 3D views for learners and researchers.
- Support headset and browser-based rendering pathways.

## Requirements
- Standardized data formats (e.g., PDB, CIF).
- Rendering pipeline that logs interactions for auditability.

## Future Tasks
- Evaluate open-source visualization engines.
- Design accessibility features (colorblind-safe palettes, subtitles).
