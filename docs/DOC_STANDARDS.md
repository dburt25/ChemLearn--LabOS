# Documentation Standards

Expectations for creating and maintaining ChemLearn LabOS docs.

## Formatting
- Use Markdown with clear headings, lists, and tables where needed.
- Include context, intent, and TODO markers for future work.

## Traceability
- Each doc should link to related artifacts (schemas, governance, roadmap).
- Major edits require notes in CHANGELOG (Phase 1+) or `compliance-notes.md`.

## Review Cadence
- Core docs (vision, invariants, governance) reviewed every phase.
- Module-specific docs reviewed when modules change versions.

## Accessibility
- Keep language concise and inclusive.
- Provide references in `REFERENCES.md` instead of duplicating long text.
