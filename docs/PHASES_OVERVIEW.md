# Phases Overview

A staged roadmap describing how ChemLearn LabOS evolves from documentation to a fully operational lab operating system.

## Phase 0 — Bootstrap (Current)
- Establish repository structure, governance docs, and data directories.
- No executable logic beyond placeholders.

## Phase 1 — LabOS Core Foundations
- Implement experiment/job/dataset registries and provenance utilities.
- Stand up change/validation logging workflows.

## Phase 2 — Data & Provenance Services
- Formalize dataset ingestion, storage tiers, and audit pipelines.
- Introduce REPL/CLI tooling for orchestrating jobs end-to-end.

## Phase 3 — Scientific Module Wave 1
- Deliver PChem and EI-MS starter modules with validation packs.
- Begin connecting UI shell to core workflows.

## Phase 4 — UI Control Panel & Modes
- Build Learner/Lab/Builder UI experiences with accessibility in mind.
- Integrate permissions matrix with front-end routing.

## Phase 5 — Advanced Modules & ML Upgrades
- Add proteomics, simulation, and visualization stacks.
- Roll out ML upgrade plan with governance gates.

## Phase 6+ — Clinical Deployment & SaMD Hardening
- Enforce Clinical Boundary Mode defaults, quality management hooks, and external audit readiness.
