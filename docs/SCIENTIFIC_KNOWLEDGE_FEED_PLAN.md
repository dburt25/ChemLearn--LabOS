# Scientific Knowledge Feed Plan

Strategy for ingesting curated scientific updates into LabOS.

## Sources
- Peer-reviewed journals
- Trusted databases (e.g., PubChem, PDB)
- Internal experiment outcomes approved for sharing

## Pipeline (Future)
1. Source scanning & triage
2. Curation and metadata tagging
3. Validation by subject-matter experts
4. Publication into modules or knowledge base

## Safeguards
- License compliance verification
- Bias and misinformation checks
