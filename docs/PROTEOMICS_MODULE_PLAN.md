# Proteomics Module Plan (Draft)

Blueprint for a future proteomics-focused module.

## Objectives
- Support peptide identification, digestion planning, and spectral analysis.
- Integrate reference datasets and scoring algorithms with LabOS Core.

## Dependencies
- Stable dataset storage with large-file handling.
- Validation pipelines using gold-standard proteomics benchmarks.

## Milestones
- Phase 3: requirements gathering & schema alignment.
- Phase 4: prototype workflows and validation harness.
- Phase 5: production-ready module with Clinical Boundary support.
