# Future Discoveries Pipeline

Outlines how new scientific discoveries flow from idea to integrated capability.

## Stages
1. **Ideation:** capture idea in `SCIENTIFIC_KNOWLEDGE_FEED_PLAN` backlog.
2. **Evaluation:** assess feasibility, compliance impact, and resource needs.
3. **Prototype:** implement sandboxed proof-of-concept with validation plan.
4. **Integration:** merge into core/modules with audit trails and docs.
5. **Monitoring:** track usage, impact, and drift.

## Governance
- Each stage requires explicit approval recorded in `compliance-notes.md`.
- Metrics and learnings documented for future retrospectives.
