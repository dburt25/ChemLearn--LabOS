# Research Use Only Notice

ChemLearn LabOS is currently intended for research and educational purposes only.

## Key Points
- Not cleared or approved as a medical device.
- Outputs must not guide clinical decisions without additional validation and regulatory authorization.
- Users are responsible for complying with local laws and institutional policies.
- Wave-2 provenance previews (jobs/datasets/audits) and workspace hooks are educational scaffolds only; lineage visibility does not confer clinical suitability.

## Next Steps
- Document readiness checkpoints for future clinical deployment in `CLINICAL_BOUNDARY_MODE.md`.
- Maintain a separate, validated build if clinical use is ever contemplated; current artifacts are for research/education only.
