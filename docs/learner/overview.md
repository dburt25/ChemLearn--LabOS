# Learner Mode Quick Notes

## Experiments, Jobs, and Modules
- **Experiments** name the study goal and owner so jobs and datasets roll up to one story.
- **Jobs** are single execution attempts within an experiment; they call a module, log parameters, link datasets, and track status.
- **Modules** are reusable scientific methods that expose operations plus citations and limitations for transparency.

## Calorimetry Basics (q, m, c, ΔT)
- Heat flow is estimated with **q = m · c · ΔT**, where *q* is heat, *m* is sample mass, *c* is specific heat capacity, and *ΔT* is the observed temperature change.
- In Learner walkthroughs we multiply the entered *c* and *ΔT* (assuming 1 g) to show how a run moves through experiment, job, and dataset records.

## EI-MS Basics
- Electron ionization mass spectrometry fragments molecules and plots peak intensities against mass-to-charge (m/z).
- A spectrum is simply that pattern of peaks, used to infer which fragments — and therefore which compounds — are present.
