# Change Types

Categories for tracking modifications in CHANGELOG and governance workflows.

## Types
- `bootstrap` — scaffolding or repo-structure work (Phase 0 focus).
- `feature` — new functionality or capability.
- `fix` — bug or defect remediation.
- `compliance` — documentation, audits, or regulatory updates.
- `data` — dataset additions/removals/migrations.
- `infra` — build, CI/CD, or tooling updates.

## Usage
- Every commit must specify exactly one primary type.
- CHANGELOG entries include type tags for filtering.
