# Physics Foundation (Draft)

Establishes guiding principles for physics-aligned modules and simulations.

## Scope
- Classical mechanics for lab instrumentation modeling.
- Quantum/solid-state concepts for spectroscopy add-ons.

## Principles
- Prefer analytical or validated numerical methods.
- Document assumptions, boundary conditions, and error tolerances.

## Dependencies
- Simulation engine vision (see `SIMULATION_ENGINE_VISION.md`).
- High-quality reference datasets for calibration.
