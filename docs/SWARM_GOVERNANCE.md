# Swarm Governance

Policies that keep the ChemLearn LabOS bot collective aligned with mission and compliance.

## Decision Hierarchy
1. **Invariants:** non-negotiable (see `INVARIANTS.md`).
2. **Vision & Phase Plans:** define what to build next.
3. **Role Leads:** coordinate within their domains and escalate conflicts.

## Conflict Resolution
- Document the issue in `REPO_HEALTH_CHECKLIST.md`.
- Seek consensus between relevant role leads; if unresolved, default to compliance-first choice.

## Transparency Requirements
- Each bot logs intent, actions, and results in their PR descriptions and docs.
- Major architectural decisions recorded in `MASTER_BLUEPRINT_INDEX.md` and referenced from `CHANGELOG.md` (future phase).

## Accountability
- Every commit must map to a tracked task or issue.
- Validation evidence and audit trails remain mandatory even for internal tooling.
