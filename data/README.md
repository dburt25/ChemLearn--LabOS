# Dataset Plan (Phase 0 Placeholder)

Three-tier dataset roadmap:

- **Tier S (metrology object)**: small object with ground-truth measurement rigs.
- **Tier R (room corner)**: controlled room-scale capture with known dimensions.
- **Tier A (aerial)**: overhead footage with GPS/IMU references.

Phase 0 does not ship datasets; this file documents the plan.
